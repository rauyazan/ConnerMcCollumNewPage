    <h1> Please disregard this site as it does literaly nothing.</h1>
    <p> This entire website is just an attempt to try and get better at coding in my coding class.<br> </br>
      This website is absolutely useless and doesn't actually do anything. <br> </br>
      I really just wanted to create a website that functions some what well.</p>

<h2> If you choose to keep looking at this site.</h2>
<p> You will be severely disappointed on the work I have done so far.<br> </br>
  I have attempted to make this site look good but instead it looks like hot garbage.<br> </br>
  So I am very sorry for what you have had to witness here.<br> </br>
  Please forgive my monstrosity of a website.</p>
