<h1> Surprise I am a student who has to go to school from 7:15-2:15 Monday-Friday </h1>
<p> I attend Madison Academic Magnet Highschool as a sophmore. <br></br>
  I am a sophmore as of the 2018-2019 school year and I am just ready to go out and do my own thing. <br> </br>
  School sucks and I don't want to be here please let me out. <br> </br>
  I'd much rather just go home and play some video games or sleep. <br> </br>
  Is it so bad to wanna go home and sleep? <br></br>
  I think we should maybe have a longer school day but include more breaks for free time. <br></br>
  Maybe just let students hvae a little free time during the day to not be overwelmed with school. <br></br>
