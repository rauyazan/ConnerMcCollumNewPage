<h1> Surprise I am a student who has to go to school from 7-2 Monday-Friday </h1>
<p> School sucks and I don't want to be here please let me out. <br> </br>
  I'd much rather just go home and play some video games. <br> </br>
  I am a sophmore as of the 2018-2019 school year and I just want it to be over.<br> </br>
  Is it so bad that i just wanna go home and sleep all day.
